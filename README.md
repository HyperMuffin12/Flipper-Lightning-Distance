# Flipper Zero Lightning Distance
An app that calculates the distance of a lightning strike based on time between seeing the flash and hearing the thunderclap.

## This app was coded by ChatGPT.
I am not, nor do I claim to be a programmer in any sense. I had an idea I thought was cool, utilised AI to make it, then published the code here.

If you have a problem with this, I'm sorry my transparcy brought you no reconciliation.
